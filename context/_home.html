        <p>Extracellular single unit recordings (‘ephys’) and calcium imaging offer
            different tradeoffs for interrogating neural activity. Ephys directly
            reports the spiking activity of neurons with a high signal-to-noise ratio,
            temporal fidelity, and dynamic range, but typically offers access only
            to a sparse subset of relatively active neurons in a local circuit.
            In addition, the ability to track the same population of neurons across time,
            important for understanding the neural basis of learning, remains challenging.
            In contrast, calcium imaging reports spiking activity indirectly.
            The transformation from spikes to calcium is non-linear because of the
            dynamics of the intracellular calcium concentration. Additional nonlinearities
            are imposed by protein-based indicators of calcium. The dynamics of
            calcium and protein indicators further conspire to produce a low-pass
            filtered and delayed version of neural activity, which complicates relating neural
            activity to behavioral events. In addition, calcium imaging has lower
            signal-to-noise ratio for detecting spikes and limited dynamic range.
            However, calcium imaging provides access to large numbers of neurons simultaneously,
            potentially with cell type specificity. Moreover, calcium imaging can
            track the activity of the same neuronal populations over time. With the development
            of highly sensitive fluorescent protein-based indicators and powerful new imaging
            methods calcium imaging has been rapidly adopted for measurements of neural population activity.

            We consider this problem in a challenging context, where the dynamics of the neural
            circuit are rich and variable across neurons. Neurons in frontal cortex fire at a wide
            range of spike rates and exhibit diverse temporal dynamics and selectivity, correlated with
            behavioral parameters. We analyzed ephys and calcium imaging measured in matched neuronal
            populations in the same behavioral task and directly compared the results of standard measurements
            of selectivity and population dynamics. We find quantitative and qualitative discrepancies
            at both the level of single cells and neural populations (<a href="#non-ephys-ca">Benchmarks and Results</a>).
