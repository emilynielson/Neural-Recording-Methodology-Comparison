                Individual neurons could exhibit diverse temporal dynamics and
                even change selectivity. We classified neurons into three broad
                categories: ‘monophasic’ neurons showed consistent selectivity
                across the trial; ‘multiphasic’ neurons changed selectivity over
                time; ‘non-selective’ neurons responded similarly across trial
                types but in a task-modulated manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                For two-alternative force choice task, neural selectivity for type A
                or type B trials was using two-sample t-tests, with neural activity
                binned over 67 ms, which corresponds to one imaging frame (~15Hz).
                A neuron was selective if it showed selectivity (p < .05) for >335 ms
                (5 continuous frames). A selective neuron was multiphasic if the polarity
                of selectivity switched, with periods of selectivity at least 335 ms long.
                Other selective neurons were monophasic. The fraction of each cell type
                is then computed for each recording and model condition.

                Slow and nonlinear dynamics of imaging can lead to a distorted view
                of neuronal dynamics, where 'peaky' neural dynamics at transitions
                between behavioral epochs in ephys seemed to be delayed and jittered,
                causing a sequence-like appearance in imaging.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ‘peakiness’ of the distribution of neuronal activity (‘s’) across
                recording modalities were measured as the difference between observed
                neural activity and temporally uniformly distributed neural activity ($P=\frac{1}{2T}$;
                T is the length of the recording/task):
                $$s=\frac{1}{P}\sqrt{P\sum_{i=A,B}\int_0^T dt(P_i(t)-P)^2}$$

                Principal component analysis (PCA) finds modes of population activity
                that capture the largest amount of variance in neural activity. This method
                usually handles the first pipeline of data processing for large-scale dataset.
                Data visualization and analysis are often performed after truncating the
                decomposition after a few components. Accordingly, if the recording method results
                in a change in the relative ranking of different sources of variance, this truncation
                will throw out different sources of variance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this study, PCA was performed on the activity of neurons averaged
                across two alternative trial types ($s\in\{A, B\}$):
                $$\mathbf{r}(s,t)=\mathbf{Cx}(s,t)+<\mathbf{r}(s,t)>_{s,t}$$
                $\mathbf{r}$ is a $n\times 2T$ matrix, where n is the number of recorded
                units in each dataset and T is the number of time points for each trial type.
                $<\mathbf{r}(s,t)>_{s,t}$ a vector of the mean activity of each neuron across time and trial types.
                $\mathbf{x}(s,t)$ is an $n\times 2T$ PC score matrix, where the $i$th row corresponds to the $i$th
                PC score. We estimated the relative contribution to each PC of the different forms of variance:
                temporal dynamics, trial-type selectivity and other. Explained variance (EV) of temporal dynamics
                $EV_i(t)$ and trial-type selectivity $EV_i(s)$ for the th principal component (PC) were computed as:
                $$EV_i(t)=<< x_i(s,t)>_s^2>_t/< x_i(s,t)^2>_{s,t}$$
                $$EV_i(t)=<< x_i(s,t)>_t^2>_s/< x_i(s,t)^2>_{s,t}$$
                respectively.

                Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is applied on neural dynamics grouped
                into bins corresponding to single imaging frames (67 ms) to compute the
                instantaneous decodability of trial type. The optimal LDA decoder was
                computed separately for each time bin, using correct trials.
                We estimated performance for the instantaneous LDA decoder by sampling a
                subset of units (10-200), and averaging 100 samplings. We separated
                the trials of each neuron into non-overlapping training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
                We then shuffled trial identity of each neuron to build up random collections
                of population activity at each time point for correct trial A (50% in training and testing)
                and trial B using all recorded neurons. The instantaneous decoder of trial type was
                computed from training set and its performance was evaluated on the testing set.

            <p>
                To achieve robust estimation given the large number of neurons, we applied a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/RDA-6.pdf">sparse version of LDA</a>.
